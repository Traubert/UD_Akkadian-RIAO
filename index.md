# UD for Akkadian <span class="flagspan"><img class="flag" src="../../flags/svg/IQ.svg" /></span>

## Tokenization and Word Segmentation

* Words are only exceptionally delimited by whitespace or punctuation in the original cuneiform texts. Thus, this treebank is based on the bound transcription (normalized text)

---
**Instruction**: Describe the general rules for delimiting words (for example, based on whitespace and punctuation) and exceptions to these rules. Specify whether words with spaces and/or multiword tokens occur. Include links to further language-specific documentation if available.

---

* In this Akkadian treebank, 13 universal tags have been used. 
* The tags AUX, INTJ, PUNCT, SYM are not used.
---
**Instruction**: Specify any unused tags. Explain what words are tagged as PART. Describe how the AUX-VERB and DET-PRON distinctions are drawn, and specify whether there are (de)verbal forms tagged as ADJ, ADV or NOUN. Include links to language-specific tag definitions if any.

There are 2 (../treebanks/LCODE-comparison.html) Akkadian UD treebanks:

  * [Akkadian-PISANDUB](../treebanks/LCODE_a/index.html)
  * [Akkadian-RIAO](../treebanks/LCODE_b/index.html)
